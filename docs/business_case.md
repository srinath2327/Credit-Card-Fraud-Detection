# Business Case – Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 1️. Background & Motivation
Credit card fraud represents less than 0.2% of transactions but can lead to substantial financial losses. Traditional detection systems often either miss fraud or generate excessive false positives, leading to operational inefficiency and poor customer experience. A predictive model can reduce losses and improve fraud detection efficiency.

## 2️. Stakeholders
- **Fraud Prevention Team:** Reduce time spent on false alerts.
- **Operations Team:** Efficient allocation of manual review resources.
- **Customers:** Protection from unauthorized transactions.
- **Compliance & Risk Teams:** Meet regulatory requirements for fraud monitoring.

---

## 3️. Assumptions & Metrics
- **Fraud Rate:** ~0.17% of all transactions.
- **Average Fraud Loss per Transaction:** ₹8,000–₹10,000.
- **Monthly Transaction Volume:** ~200,000 transactions.
- **Success Metric:** Maintain Recall ≥ 85%, Precision ≥ 15% after threshold tuning.

---

## 4️. Financial Impact Calculation
- Fraudulent transactions detected (Recall ~92%): ~312/month.
- Losses prevented per month: 312 × ₹8,000 ≈ ₹24.9 lakh.
- Annualized savings: ₹3–3.5 crore (assuming stable model performance).

---

## 5️. Deployment & Monitoring Plan
### Phase 1 – Pilot Deployment
- Deploy model at tuned threshold (≈0.35).
- All flagged transactions sent for manual review.

### Phase 2 – Operational Integration
- Block top 1% highest-risk transactions automatically.
- Route medium-risk cases to manual review.

### Phase 3 – Monitoring & Maintenance
- Monitor monthly performance metrics (Recall, Precision).
- Retrain model quarterly with updated data.
- Adjust threshold to adapt to new fraud patterns.

---

## 6️. Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Fraud tactics evolve quickly.
  - *Mitigation:* Continuous monitoring, periodic retraining.
- **Risk:** High false positives affecting customer experience.
  - *Mitigation:* Careful threshold tuning, tiered alerting system.

## 7️. Conclusion
The fraud detection model provides a significant return on investment by reducing financial losses while maintaining operational efficiency. With proper deployment, threshold management, and ongoing monitoring, the system supports both business and customer trust.
